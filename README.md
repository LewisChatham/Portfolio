# <CSS Portfolio>
## Description

Welcome to my CSS Portfolio.

My motivation for creating this porject was largely to explore new concepts, such as flexbox, media queries and semantic elements.

The reason I built a portfolio, is to host my current and future projects, and to have a central location where I can access and showcase all of my work.

I learnt a lot about trying to get flexbox to work for me, and pairing it with padding sometimes leads to questionable outputs.

## Usage

To use the portfolio, you can navigate using the links at the top of the page, which will take you to the corresponding sections.

In each section you will find information about me which can be digested, visited or used. (in that order)

Clicking on a 'project card' in the "Work" section will take you to an external website, where you can view that project.

Currently there are no projects available to be hosted, but i will be updating this in the near future.
